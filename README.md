# Codeflow

Codeflow aims to speed up devs onboarding on a codebase (or a new area of a codebase).

Devs spend a lot of time reading and understanding code.

Codeflow's goal is to make this process quicker by generating diagrams of code flows, architecture, etc., from annotations in the codebase, making it easier to keep it up to date and fostering collaboration from all team members.

# Example

Codeflow is in an early stage.

Thoughts and contributions are welcome.
